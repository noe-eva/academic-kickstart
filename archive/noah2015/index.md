abstract: Swiss German is a dialect continuum whose dialects are very different from Standard German,the official language of the German part of Switzerland. However, dealing with Swiss German innatural language processing, usually the detour through Standard German is taken. As writing inSwiss German has become more and more popular in recent years, we would like to provide datato serve as a stepping stone to automatically process the dialects. We compiled NOAH’s Corpusof Swiss German Dialects consisting of various text genres, manually annotated with Part-ofSpeech tags. Furthermore, we applied this corpus as training set to a statistical Part-of-Speechtagger and achieved an accuracy of 90.62%.
